- need a second phase variable resolution. Right now values have to be resolved
during build and cannot then be changed during deployment. Would be best if it
were possible to apply the variables last minute during deploy.
- add variable support to moltres.json, module.json and plugin.json files
```
${env.SOME_VAR}
${option.someoption}
```
- make dependsOn declarations an object instead of an array
- allow config to be specified when declaring dependencies
- support dependency resolution in both react-native (requires statically outputting dependencies)
- figure out how to allow for modules that provide all of the following in one package
  - backend functions
  - frontend components
  - common module logic
